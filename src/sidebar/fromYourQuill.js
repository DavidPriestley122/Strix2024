  <h1>A Dream in the Wood</h1>
  
  <section>
    <p>It had been a frustrating morning in the cathedral archives, chasing documents that turned out no longer to exist, or -- when they did -- finding them partial or damaged; so that it was relief to get out into the crisp autumn afternoon air and begin the long walk back to the cottage I had rented about four miles west of the city.</p>
    
    <p>The first part of the walk took me through the narrow winding streets of the old city. Dickensian-looking shops lined this part of the route, and it was a pleasure to stroll past their quirky exteriors, occasionally glancing inside. A particular favourite of mine was a small book-cum-curiosity shop in the western quarter which had proved to be a good hunting-ground for rare editions, and when I arrived at its window I stopped briefly to check if the shopkeeper had added anything new to his display. I couldn't see any books of interest, but in the middle of the window, on a little stand, was an odd-looking wooden game, looking rather like a chess-set crossed with a hedgehog. The box it came in was set to one side and had on its cover an image of a stylized owl, swooping towards the viewer. I was tempted to go in and ask the proprietor about the game -- I could see him moving around deeper in the shop, his round-rimmed spectacles occasionally catching the afternoon light -- but keen to press on, I resolved to visit the shop on the following day, and set off again on my westward path.</p>

  <section>
    <p>Once beyond the outskirts, my usual way followed a country lane before cutting through a tract of old woodland composed of chestnut coppice punctuated with tall oaks. On this occasion, however, perhaps still distracted by thoughts of my unsatisfying researches, I failed to notice that I had strayed from my normal path. But with the sunlight slanting through the thinning canopy and the thickening carpet of dry leaves at my feet to kick through like a schoolboy, I felt happy to go exploring for a change. I had not been strolling like this for more than about a quarter of an hour when I came upon a clearing in the woods, rather regular in shape, in the centre of which stood a majestic ancient oak tree. There was little breeze or birdsong, so that as I stood gazing at this splendid survivor from medieval times a silence surrounded me, almost as if I was back in the cathedral. With deferential step, anxious not to break the spell, I approached the tree. Its girth was remarkable -- I don't think six of me could have circled it with outstretched arms -- and its gnarled bark was riven with deep fissures. Massive branches radiated through the space of the clearing, criss-crossing each other at different heights. One huge bough had broken off about twelve feet above the ground and now lay athwart the trunk, creating a kind of a ramp.</p>
    
    <p>With the adventurous spirit still active within me I ascended the bough, till reaching the top, I found myself peering into a cavernous hollow within the trunk of the oak tree. The afternoon sun, from the west, illuminated the inside of this hollow, revealing a roughly domed space partially filled, predictably, with old twigs and leaves from former birds' nests. Covering most of the walls of the hollow, more oddly, were numerous scratches and gouges, as if made by claws or talons. Pondering the significance of these marks, I climbed back down the branch to the ground again. A few birds had broken into song, a light breeze had set the drying leaves of the trees a-murmur and the sun was warm on my face, all causing in me a sense of peace and drowsiness so that I decided to sit for a while and enjoy the sensation. My seat was the curved lower part of the large broken branch, my backrest the trunk of the great oak itself.... and before long I slipped away into a gentle sleep.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>I dreamed. It was one of those dreams that seemed more real than reality itself, with all the senses heightened and a feeling that I had only to turn my attention to something to understand depths normally hidden to me while awake. In this dream I decided to re-examine the hollow in the oak, and rising from my seat, clambered again up the large ramp-like branch. I peered again into the large hole. At first everything appeared as before, but before long I began to notice that the scratches and gouges in the inner walls of the hollow had taken on the character of writing, a feeling that grew stronger with every passing second until, striking my palm to my forehead and calling myself a dolt, I realized <em>of course</em> that the marks were owl runes. Owl runes, as I now knew with absolute clarity, were the only known form of avian written language, and as I examined them, two further details became evident: that the runes formed part of a text and that many of the runes repeated at the beginning of the words, suggesting head-rhymed verse as preferred by the Anglo-Saxon poets. Armed with this knowledge, the verse seemed almost to construe itself in my mind, so that in a short space of time I found myself able to read it without difficulty and could see that if formed a riddle. Here it is, in my translation.</p>

    <blockquote>
      <p>I am the Middle Oak from pointed acorn grown,<br>
      The origin of this wood now weighted down with age.<br>
      On my shoulders I carry the three corners of creation.<br>
      My roots reach down to rock, yet<br>
      I can leap up and look to left and right.<br>
      My canopy is the cosmos, my crown is rimmed in green.<br>
      Nights and days dance weekly down my sides.<br>
      My hollow heart is a hall for Owls<br>
      Fiercely tested by triple tournament, aided<br>
      By Kite captains and croaking Ravens.<br>
      My first is in stone, my last stands by the water's edge<br>
      If you can tell me, reader, who I am, then look to your rear!</p>
    </blockquote>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>I retracted my head from the entrance and rather puzzled, looked around as instructed by the riddle. I could not immediately see anything untoward. What could it all mean? Then, unbidden, an image of the strange wooden game I had seen in the shop window sprang to my mind. That certainly had three corners and a green edge. And there was a picture of an owl on the box. Perhaps the pieces represented birds, so why not owls? My mind still working with unusual clarity, I then remembered a small sign that had been placed in front of the game, reading "Strix". Of course, that was it! The first rune in the name would be Stan, "stone" for "st" and the last would be <em>Eolh-secg</em> "elk-sedge" for "x". I smiled to myself that I had solved the riddle so quickly; but now - I thought - would my solving it trigger whatever the last line warned me about?</p>

    <p>Sure enough, as I listened, I could hear a commotion in the canopy at the edge of the clearing. The sound of what must have been brawling ravens, screaming and cronking, grew steadily in volume with, occasionally, a red kite's keening wolf-whistle over the top. Then, bursting from the foliage in a flurry of feathers, a huge tawny owl hurled itself towards me, talons extended. Ducking instinctively, I caught a glimpse of barred plumage passing over my head into the hollow in the oak tree. Terrified, I scuttled down the sloping branch but caught my foot and tripped, sprawling to the forest floor and banging my head on a projecting root......and woke up.</p>
  </section>

  <section>
    <p>Unsettled by the memory of the dream with its shocking ending, I peered around woozily. The hollow appeared empty as before, and the sight of some of the scratches that I had interpreted as "owl runes" brought over me a sense of sheepishness: how embarrassing to have thought such nonsense, and worse, that I should have felt pride in solving a riddle that --presumably -- my dream self had invented! I decided it was high time to leave this strange place. So, with the light starting to fail, I took a bearing from the setting sun, and set off back into the woods. Before long I struck a familiar path, and not half an hour later, feeling distinctly relieved, I found myself at the little wooden gate to my cottage.</p>

    <p>Later that evening, sitting by a crackling fire in my battered upholstered chair, I reflected on my experiences of the day. Deeming them worthy of a short record, I took up my pen and pulled from my breast pocket the small journal I kept there. As I opened it to a new page, a feather wafted up into the air. Surprised, I watched it drifting gently down in little swoops, then, coming to my senses, I plucked it inexpertly from the air. I could see at once the banded pattern characteristic of the tawny owl. How could....? I sat for a while, nonplussed. Then, getting up, I moved to the window, drew back the curtain and opened the creaky casement. The night air flowed over me, and upon it, from the direction of the clearing in the wood, came the faint but clear repeated call: "Who? Who? .....Who? Who?"</p>

    <p>"Who, indeed?" I thought. Much better I should stick to my studies than go adventuring in woods like a pioneer again. Still, I did feel a strange connection between these faery events and the shopkeeper and his curious spiky game. Tomorrow, I resolved, as I later mounted the narrow staircase to my bedroom, I would go and pay him a visit.</p>

       <h2>The Oak's Lament</h2>

  <p>Who? Who has carved these runes, scoring my oaken walls<br>
  With talons and tearing beak? It was Tyto the Owl-poet,<br>
  Yet I forgive him his ferocity, for he furnishes me with a voice.</p>

  <p>"Listen now!  I am the great Oak, against the grind of ages<br>
  Still I stand, steadfast, provider of nest-holes to the royal line<br>
  But now my boughs are bent with woe, bereft and leafless<br>
  For Ulifu the Grey Grandmother, guardian of Owl-kind<br>
  From fledgling fearless, grown to fair-minded Strix-queen<br>
  Has fallen, far away, fighting in the forests of the north.</p>

  <p>Who? Who will dare to take her place, to dwell inside my palace-nest,<br>
  Delivering peace to the three directions and driving away enemies?<br>
  Even the ten-twigged turn back, terrified by her war-call,<br>
  And leave alone her lofty precincts, and the land beneath.<br>
  All my slow years, from youth to yesterday, none could match her<br>
  For quickness of wit or quietness of flight. Her queenly ways<br>
  Were famed abroad. All the feathered felt her sway,<br>
  And like this old Oak, how low and hollow now. And yet,<br>
  the moon will wax once more, and waiting in the forest corners<br>
  her three children, royal owl-chicks, chased away at fledging,<br>
  turn their fine plumed heads this way, each plotting coronation.</p>

  <p>Who? Who are these clutch-mates, claimants now to Ulifu's crown?<br>
  First shell-broacher, Prince Bredgar, speckled-brown of feather<br>
  Holds demesne in the deep woods, Brundak his Kite captain<br>
  And Bertravel, his battle-Raven, blue-black in her plumage.<br>
  Next is Princess Elwyna, yellow her face with eyes of black<br>
  She dwells in the dark-dappled dell by the forest edge.<br>
  Yeldak Forktail and Elravel of the Ravenkind make her shield.<br>
  Youngest and last to take wing, Princess Grenna, green her symbol.<br>
  From the deepest glades she flies, graceful and swift.<br>
  Grindak Kite and Grenavel the Raven guard her, grim warriors both.</p>

  <p>Who? Who among them will claim my crown-nest first?"</p>

       <h2>The Call Goes Out</h2>
         <p>"Listen!<br>
  I am Ullwood.  The dweller in my nest-hollow<br>
  By the authority of ages is acclaimed as Strix,<br>
  Owl-monarch of the myriad moonlit glades,<br>
  To whom all forest fowl owe fealty and love.<br>
  Since saplinghood, Strix-sovereigns have reared<br>
  Their broods embraced by my boughs, and standing<br>
  Tall on my perches, proclaimed the Pax Silvana.<br>
  But life is brief, and night falls even on an Owl.<br>
  Cold and quiet come to my oaken corridors. Then<br>
  Through my twigs to the forest edge the call goes out:</p>

  <p>"The Nest is Empty!  Let the next Strix be chosen!<br>
  Let the Threefold Tourney take place!  First Owl<br>
  To reach me reigns!"  Then rising from their royal ease<br>
  The Owl-princes and princesses pivot at last<br>
  Towards the centre. Kite captains counsel them<br>
  And restless Ravens ready for the wrangle ahead.<br>
  Then the canopy is a-cry with combat, as along<br>
  The flightways, feinting and faking, the teams<br>
  Battle past boles and through branches until<br>
  One winning Owl arrives here. Until then I wait."</p>
