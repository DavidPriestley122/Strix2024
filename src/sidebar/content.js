        <p style='margin-right:0cm;margin-left:0cm;font-size:16px;font-family:"Times New Roman",serif;'>STRIX was conceived and is best played as a game for three players. However, several two-player variants of the game exist. The following describes the variant that most closely approximates the three-player game:</p>

            <li>The starting position is the same as for three-player STRIX.</li>
